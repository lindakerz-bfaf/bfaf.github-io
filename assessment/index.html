          <h4>Assessing a firm</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">This questionnaire aims to assess a retail firm against the dominant factors which have caused large and mature retail firms to fail in the past. To achieve this, two events-based tests are conducted to quantify and determine an organizations susceptibility to failure. One test explores dominant failure symptoms to identify the timeframe of failure an organization is in. The other test explores the degree of presence in the dominant failure factors to identify the threat. Collectively the insights derived from the assessment will enable you to optimally understand the firm’s failure positions in relation to the aspects that caused large and mature retails firms to fail in the past.</p>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">For each question, click the answer that best reflects the firm or your view of the firm. A working knowledge of the firm or individual research may be required to address the various questions. Evidently, the higher the degree of objective factors that underpin the responses, the more reliable the results will be.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Please answer the questions in consideration of the firm’s present-day state (rather than of how the firm once was or aspires to be). Don't worry if some questions seem to score in the 'wrong direction'. Depending on your question responses, there could be up to 3 pages of questions. Please be sure to answer all presented questions.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Once you complete the questions you will be automatically directed to the results dashboard where you can evaluate the firm’s failure position and view strategic insights to navigate the firm's given failure positions optimally. We do not save any of the response. Please ensure to print the results upon completion for future use.</p>

                      <p>Various strategies can be adopted if a recession is on the horizon:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The best way for companies to prepare for a recession is to decrease their financial leverage. The key to surviving an economic downturn is to have a strong equity buffer and conservative debt levels. This can be achieved by using free cash flow to pay down debt instead of directing it to share buybacks. Minimal debt obligations can present flexibility in managing the downside and allow organisations to be opportunistic on the upside.</li>
                        <li>Unexpected developments can derail businesses. As such, it also important to stress-test the business and prepare for various disaster scenarios now to understand their inherent implications (i.e. handling sharp drops in sales) </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Various strategies can be adopted if a recession is in progress:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>During recessionary downturn it is common for managers to introduce new programs in hope of either increasing sales (i.e. offer to extended store opening hours or by introducing a loyalty program) or cutting costs (i.e. reducing store hours or reorganizing store operations). Although increasing revenue and cutting cost both are key in staying afloat during a recession, these measures without proper analysis and due diligence could prove fatal.</li>
                        <li>During recession, the firm’s loyal customers maybe spending less, but they would be still be spending with the firm. Similarly, a competitor’s loyal customers will be spending their money with the competitor and it will be tough to win them over. Firms should focus on the “switchers” which are neither the firm’s nor the competitors loyal customers. These customers can be acquired based on category, market, or other form of segmentation and by performing targeting and meaningful marketing activities to attract them.</li>
                        <li>Another potential way to increase revenue is to find out if there are additional needs for existing loyal customers. HBS calls this “closing the needs-offer gap”. Perform customer feedback analysis to identify such gaps and try to fill them. These gaps may not always arise from your product offering or product mix but can also include need-offer gaps in service or even in customer’s understanding or interpretation of the service provided.</li>
                        <li>As a given, during a recession firms would cut down costs. The important thing is to distinguish between good costs and bad costs, keeping the customer in mind. During a recession, when it’s hard to get more customers or to increase spending, firms should not cut good costs, i.e. the costs that help to engage with the customer like costs associated with providing convenience, shopping experience, or a better range. Rather the firm should identify and reduce costs that do not contribute towards willingness of customer to spend more.</li>
                        <li>Another way to reduce costs is to cluster stores thus reducing their operational and inventory cost.</li>
                        <li>Whilst all necessary steps are performed, firms should ensure that it's core processes (customer research, merchandise planning, performance management and strategic planning) are not ignored, rather are retooled.</li>

                      <p>The firm should also focus on Customer experience and improve their brand image to help to create further demand in the market. In recent times, customers have shifted their loyalty based on new values such as sustainability, environmentaly friendly, ethical, work-force friendly etc. These have become major forces in recent times impacting brand loyalty. Please remember that one size may not fit for all. It is essential that any new marketing should be based on proper STP (Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning) based on data available, insight gathered, and market research conducted.</p>

                      <p>Disruption in an industry could sink firms if they are not riding ahead of the wave. Those firms who are the first to identify and capitalize on the disruption can thrive while others struggle to keep up and lose the early mover advantage.</p>
                      <p>Firms facing a high-risk threat from industry disruptive have already missed the wave. Immediate efforts should be initially directed towards catching up. This is easier said than done (i.e. many firms trying to mimic Walmarts model failed because of the lack of a central management system). It is important to understand not just the model, but what makes the model successful. Experts from relevant areas should be recruited, either as direct employees or consultants, to bring the firm up to date to capitalize on the disruption.</p>
                      <p>It is recommended that firms deploy the means to monitor and identify any disruptions in the industry. The firm should first identify the key indicators which could signal disruptions. These signals may not always come from the retail industry, but could originate in other industries such as telecommunications (technology related), banking (process or financial transactions related) etc. Once the indicators are identified, the firm must listen to and react to these indicators. This may be done through setting up a Strategic Insight team who would advise the senior management team well in advance to prepare for future disruption.</p>
                      <p>Once identified, the Firm must find ways to stay ahead of the curve by innovating, executing, or delivering on the innovation and finally realize benefits from the innovation. If this results in a potential Diversification, the firm should take a decision by analyzing cost benefit and what-if scenarios. Any overcommitment could mean resource misallocation resulting in taking a hit on overall Firm performance. It is worth keeping in mind that the diversification may not always come from within the firm, but sometimes through strategic partnership, even outside the industry. This could also mean bringing in non-retail expertise to manage such partnership if these plans are gone through strategic analysis.</p>

                      <p>By working on each, leaders can improve their ability to make sense of an ambiguous situation and conceptualize better strategies. Once the strategy is conceptualized, it must be effectively executed to prevent a strategic error. Leinwand and Rotering (2017) share some questions to think through to improve the strategy-to-execution continuum.</p>
                      <p>Build the strategy:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Are you very clear about how you add value to customers in a way that others don’t, and about the specific capabilities that enable you to excel at that value proposition?</li>
                        <li>As strategies are being developed, are you using the classic approach of “build the strategy, then think about execution,” or are you asking yourself the question, “Do you have the capabilities needed—or can you build the capabilities needed—to execute the strategy?”</li>
                        <li>As you’re dealing with disruption, are you shaping the world around you with your given strengths, or are you waiting for change to happen, and therefore playing by someone else’s rules?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Translate the strategy into the everyday:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Are you diligently following through on what you have decided? </li>
                        <li>Are there visible programs (for example specific new technologies, new processes, or training programs) to build the key capabilities your organization needs to win with its strategy?</li>
                        <li>Are you building specific connections between strategy and the budgeting process so you’re reallocating funds to where they matter most? And do you have mechanisms in place that translate the strategy into personal goals and rewards for managers and employees?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Execute the strategy:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Are you motivating employees every single day to understand how what they’re doing connects to the important strategic levers that you have focused on?</li>
                        <li>Are you enabling employees to work together across organizational silos to tackle the cross-functional challenges that allow the company to win?</li>
                        <li>Are you keeping track not just of your performance, but of how you’re building and scaling up those few key capabilities that enable you to create value for customers in ways that others cannot?</li>
                        <li>Is your management team engaged in how you are executing the strategy—not just by measuring results, but by constantly challenging the organization and supporting it in improving its key capabilities? Are you setting your team’s sights high enough for what they need to accomplish, and by when?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Getting these areas right allows leaders to reduce the risk of strategic errors occurring due to poor execution.</p>

                      <p>Strategic foresight must be sharp and accurate to navigate failure successfully. The quest to build your strategic thinking skills can be uncomfortable and, in most cases, requires a complete change in mindset. Bowman (2016) identifies three key areas to focus on to enhance strategic prowess:</p>
                      <p><strong>Know: Observe and Seek Trends</strong></p>
                      <p>To be strategic, you need a solid understanding of the industry context, trends, and business drivers. An intellectual appreciation of the importance of bringing in current data and seeking trends is not enough. You also must:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Make it a routine exercise to explore and synthesize the internal trends in your day-to-day work. </li>
                        <li>Be proactive about connecting with peers both in your organization and in your industry to understand their observations of the marketplace. Then, share your findings across your network.</li>
                        <li>Understand the unique information and perspective that your function provides and define its impact on the corporate level strategy.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Think: Ask the Tough Questions</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>With a fresh understanding of trends and issues, you can practice using strategic thinking by asking yourself, “How do I broaden what I consider?”</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Act: Make Time for Thinking and Embrace Conflict</strong></p>
                      <p>To bring full value to the table, started evaluating tasks based on urgency and importance as outlined in Covey’s 2 x 2 matrix (2005). Learned to embrace debate and to invite challenge, without letting it get personal. To do this, focused on issues, not people, and use neutral peers to challenge your thinking. To manage the inevitable ambiguity that arises when you ask more questions, learned to clarify your decision-making criteria. This will allow you to better act in the face of imperfect information.</p>
                      <p>The use of external consultants is also beneficial to an objective outsider's perspective and improve the strategic direction for the firm.</p>
                      <p>This guidance should help to improve strategic foresight as you comprehensively build awareness around the changes and challenges you the firm faces. </p>

                      <p>Management cannot be complacent in a constantly evolving business environment. As such, responding to changes in your environment requires constant attention. Barker (2005) shares ways that leaders can address complacency pitfalls by investigating the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Top managers should directly engage the environment. They can decrease their chances of misperceiving the causes of business decline by not relying on filtered or distorted data. By talking directly and frankly with entry‐level employees, customers, and suppliers, they can learn a lot about how the organization is failing. So, for example, when a key customer defects to a competitor, the CEO needs to visit that customer and find out exactly why the customer left. Such frank discussions can often reveal where real organizational problems lie. Also, entry level employees often know about problems that their supervisors are either unaware of or are unwilling to pass up the hierarchy. Better information will make for better perception of problems.</li>
                        <li>Have a diversified management team that shares individual viewpoints. If every member of the top management team has a similar background and tenure in the organization, they will probably share the same personality idiosyncrasies in diagnosing decline. Greater diversity of experiences will generate more ideas to explore as possible sources of decline and possible turnaround actions. However, the top management team must not be so diverse that they cannot communicate seamlessly and work together. Sharing and honestly debating divergent viewpoints is what unlocks more ideas from the top management group.</li>
                        <li>Get outside advice on major problems and issues. Because top managers have a difficult time seeing their organizations objectively, outside perspectives can help provide input into diagnosing and treating decline. Most consulting firms, however, do not have the industry expertise or knowledge of organizational history to effectively diagnose and treat decline. Instead, top managers need key outsiders that they can turn to for advice or guidance when needed. These outsiders can come from several sources; independent board members who have been through turnarounds or crises before with other organizations are a great source of advice.</li>

                      <p>Breaking free of an overly protective or inflated ego and avoiding the leadership bubble is an important and challenging job in navigating failure risks. It requires selflessness, reflection, and courage. Hougaard and Carter (2018) offer a few tips that will help manage hubris behaviors: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Consider the perks and privileges you are being offered in your role. Some of them enable you to do your job effectively. But some of them are simply perks to promote your status and power and ultimately ego. Consider which of your privileges you can let go of. (i.e. it could be the reserved parking spot or a special pass for the elevator) </li>
                        <li>Support, develop, and work with people who will not feed your ego. Hire smart people with the confidence to speak up. </li>
                        <li>Humility and gratitude are cornerstones of selflessness. Make a habit of taking a moment at the end of each day to reflect on all the people that were part of making you successful on that day. This helps you develop a natural sense of humility, by seeing how you are not the only cause of your success. And end the reflection by actively sending a message of gratitude to those people. </li>

                      <p>Similarly, before entering a price-war or a product competition, the firm should have known all its competitors and used tools such as a CV matrix to find who the actual competitor is, should use a pay-off matrix to analyse the possible outcomes, and should use scenario planning and responsive evaluation analysis to predict and prepare for various outcomes. The firm should only engage if it has a plan and resources to execute its plan.</p>

                        <li><strong>Problem identification:</strong> If a strategic plan failed, then it is not fault of an individual or a specific department. It is a failure of collaboration, coordination and opacity of implementation. Whether the failure came in the form of product failure, or failure of marketing strategy that didn't bring in new customers, as a business did something that people didn't respond to. The next step is to compare your failed strategy to past successes, and the successes and failures of competitors. Trying a new strategy out without identifying the reasons this one failed is no better than trial and error and that's no way to run a business. Some of the possibilities of a plan failure are:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Solving an Irrelevant Customer Job</li>

                            <li>Poor Execution</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Connecting with Employees:</strong> Communication is a key in the event of business plan/strategy failure. A strategy is collaboration of multiple departments and individuals; therefore, it is necessary that everyone has a clear view of next steps. It is essential that there is confidence in the organisation, and the vision is not shaken due to a failure. The most important step is to reconnect with employees and share management direction and plan. Employees don't necessarily commit to a company, they commit to a person, to a leader, so leadership must be delivered and trust in the vision has to be reinforced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong> After the failed business activities are identified, the nest step is to analyse ‘how’ and if possible, then ‘when’ those can be fixed. For example, maybe a new product launch failed. If it was because your raw material was too expensive, figure out how the supply chain can be adjusted to make it agile and cost effective. If business has to move to a new location and but found the costs too high, consider expanding or renovating your current location instead. As a strategy it is more about making the best possible use of the available resources to achieve the best results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Don't hide from the mistakes. Business is about admitting that that something didn't work out as planned; let investors, employees and clients know that a problem is recognized and, as an organisation, you are ready to move on with a new strategy. Announce the next strategy publicly, be it with a business plan, which investors can access or an announcement of a new location on your company's website, and people will see and believe that you know what you're doing.</li>

                      <p>Key aspects of survival are the service and the quality of the products. Failing in any of these will damage the firm’s reputation in ways that are not easily recoverable. The firm must move quickly to identify if the current situation is caused by reduction in the quality of product or service. These can be found through various means, one of them could be gathering feedback from the consumers through various channels, e.g. gauging social media reaction.

                      <p>If the insight reveals poor product quality, immediate attention should be paid to the production line, inventory management system and processes, supplier management system and processes etc. Considering implementing TQM (total quality management). Firm should also consider bringing in consultants to analyse operations and tease out quality impacts and provide resolutions to fix them. While fixing the quality of the product, the firm should also take immediate corrective action to fix the quality lapses that have already happened. These could be in form of product replacements, additional coupons for customers etc. The reputational damage caused should also be mitigated by devising, advertising and implementing additional guarantees to the customer. </p>
                      <p>Service quality impacted can be measured through drop in customer experience. In the digital age, consumer experience overlaps the digital and physical space.

Customer interacting with employees (e.g. storefront staff and online support staff) should be motivated, informed and trained. The Digital or Physical storefront is not just a sales channel but also a great opportunity to engage and retain customers. Firm should consider implementing (if not already implemented) effective systems and process to streamline their CRM systems. </p>
