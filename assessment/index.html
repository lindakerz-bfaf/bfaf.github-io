          <h4>Assessing a firm</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">This questionnaire aims to assess a retail firm against the dominant factors which have caused large and mature retail firms to fail in the past. To achieve this, two events-based tests are conducted to quantify and determine an organizations susceptibility to failure. One test explores dominant failure symptoms to identify the timeframe of failure an organization is in. The other test explores the degree of presence in the dominant failure factors to identify the threat. Collectively the insights derived from the assessment will enable you to optimally understand the firm’s failure positions in relation to the aspects that caused large and mature retails firms to fail in the past.</p>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">For each question, click the answer that best reflects the firm or your view of the firm. A working knowledge of the firm or individual research may be required to address the various questions. Evidently, the higher the degree of objective factors that underpin the responses, the more reliable the results will be.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Please answer the questions in consideration of the firm’s present-day state (rather than of how the firm once was or aspires to be). Don't worry if some questions seem to score in the 'wrong direction'. Depending on your question responses, there could be up to 3 pages of questions. Please be sure to answer all presented questions.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Once you complete the questions you will be automatically directed to the results dashboard where you can evaluate the firm’s failure position and view strategic insights to navigate the firm's given failure positions optimally. We do not save any of the response. Please ensure to print the results upon completion for future use.</p>

Supporting commentary is provided in each section to help you interpret the results.
