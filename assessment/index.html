          <h4>Assess a firm</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">This tool aims to evaluate the asymmetric forces occurring as the firm battles versus the internal firm environment (The Firm), versus the immediate environment (Micro) and versus the general environment (Macro) by using an events-based assessing technique to quantify and portray the presence of dominant failure factors and symptoms. This Assessment will help you to uncover an organizations susceptibility to threatening failure instances and place you in an advantageous position to deploy enhanced strategic actions or corrective actions before it’s too late.</p>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">For each question, click the answer that best reflects the firm or your view of the firm. A working knowledge of the firm or Individual research may be required to address the various question. Evidently, the higher the degree of objective factors that underpin the responses, the more reliable the results will be. Please answer questions in consideration of the firm’s present-day state (rather than of how the firm once was or aspires to be). Don't worry if some questions seem to score in the 'wrong direction'. Please be sure to answer all the presented questions. When you are finished, please click the 'Calculate My Total' button at the bottom of the test. You will then be automatically directed to the results dashboard where you can evaluate the firm’s failure position and view strategic insights to navigate the firm's given failure positions optimally. We do not save any of the response. Please ensure to print the results upon completion.</p>

          <p class="left-align light">Our research on large and mature failed organizations emphasized that as organizations continue along the continuum of existence, they are in a constant battle against various failure factors associated amongst three environment domains, they battle versus the internal firm environment (The Firm), versus the immediate environment (Micro) and versus the general environment (Macro). This results dashboard aims to portray a firm’s susceptibility to variables and indicators of impending business failure through (1) Producing an Overall Failure Score, (2) Utilizing the proposed framework to showcase the failure factors influencing an organization's failure position (3) Providing insights into the environment and associated factors that present the most significant risks to you.</p>
