            <h4>About the Framework and Assessing Tool</h4>
            <br/>
            <p>Our research on large and mature failed retailers emphasized that as organizations continue along the continuum of existence, they are in a constant battle against various failure factors associated amongst three environment domains, they battle versus the internal firm environment (The Firm), versus the immediate environment (Micro) and versus the general environment (Macro). Business failure occurs when the strength of a single failure force, or clustering of failure forces, at various points in time overpowers, or un-aligns with, the array resources and capabilities of the firm. As a result, negatively position the organization to a new point of failure. The new position of failure largely depends on the strength of the failure force or the degree of unalignment of the failure force in relation to the resource and capabilities or defending mechanism available to the firm. If a firm has inadequate or poorly deployed resources and capabilities to combat the threatening failure forces, the existing and even potentially new failure forces (stemming from similar or new environment domains) will progressively push the organization into a new realm of failure, and ultimately, towards the point of absolute failure.</p>

            <p>Firms with resources and capabilities that overpower the threatening failure factors experience superior success (The green block). In addition, firms with substantial resources and capabilities, or the ability to accumulated new resources and capabilities, can battle back, outperform and preserve beyond the failure factors they encounter. This perseverance can occur at any stage of the failure process, emphasizing that firms can always avoid, or prolong, failure given they possess or can generate more significant internal resources and capabilities. </p>

            <p>This understanding of business failure broadly identifies that firms that operate in perpetuity equally face failure threats in perpetuity. In most cases, these failure threats probably go unnoticed because of their weak nature and dominant dynamics of the firm’s resources and capabilities. Albeit, the failure threat was present, nonetheless.  </p>

            <p>With this understanding of a constant threat of failure, it can be argued that firms need enhanced tools to interpret failure factors at granular and stages of the failure process to effectively distinguish and navigate severe failure threats, concerning failure threats and nonobvious weak threats which could strengthen individually, or collectively cluster to a level that successfully challenges the firm's resources and capabilities. A quantitative or primarily financial driven tool would provide limited insights into the granular characteristics or domains of the failure factors. However, emphasizing the importance of quantitative and events-based assessing methods.</p>

            <p>The conceptualized tool aims to explore the asymmetric forces occurring as the firm battles versus the internal firm environment (The Firm), versus the immediate environment (Micro) and versus the general environment (Macro) by using an events-based assessing technique to quantify and portray the presence of dominant failure factors and symptoms. This Assessment helps individuals to uncover organizations susceptibility to threatening failure instances and place them in an advantageous position to deploy enhanced strategic actions or corrective actions before it’s too late. </p>
